This document describes the requirements for TankWar. The template for the Software
Requirements Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere template~\citep{RobertsonAndRobertson2012}.  %If you make further modifications
%to the template, you should explicity state what modifications were made.

\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
The purpose of this \underline{project} is to recreate and upgrade the game BattleCity. BattleCity was one of the most popular games decades ago, and it was usually on family computers. However, a family computer is hard to find today, and the game BattleCity is also someway too simple for today’s person, so we are going to upgrade it to a new game called TankWar, which will be compatible with modern computers. Also more modes will be added in the upgraded version. The first one is the player versus player mode, which can increase the competitiveness of the game. The other new mode is the map editor, which allows the players to create a new map on their own to increase their interest.
\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}
The clients for this \underline{project} are Dr.Asghar A Bokhari, and the TAs, Andrew Lucentini and Maryam Hosseinkord. They will be the final reviewer of our \underline{project}.
\subsubsection{The Users} 
The users for this \underline{project} are all the people who want to play this new game. \textcolor{red}{Therefore, the potential users can be anyone above 12 years old with simple compute operation knowledge and the ability to operate a keyboard.} \textcolor{red}{\sout{Our game is developed for all ages. Therefore the potential costumers can be anyone at any age.}}\\

\textcolor{red}{Comments: This was "The Customers" in the original template, but I think the word users are more appropriate since our product is totally free and accessible for anyone.}

  FR19. In \underline{PVE} mode, the system shall display the lost result if the players' home base is destroyed or the players' tanks died 3 times in 3 minutes, otherwise display the win result.\\
  \textcolor{red}{Rationale: The rules of PVE mode are necessary for PVE game.\\
  Fit criterion: Check whether the corresponding result is shown after finishing the whole game. To be more specific, check whether the win result is showned if both players' tanks did not die for three times or the home base is destroyed. Check whether the lost result is showned after both players' tanks is destroyed three times or the home base is destrroyed.}\\ \newline
  FR20. In \underline{PVP} mode, the system shall display a win result if the player's tank destroy another player's home base or kill the other player's tank 3 times in 3 minutes. Otherwise it will be a tie.\\
  \textcolor{red}{Rationale: The rules of PVP mode are necessary for PVP game.\\
  Fit criterion: Check whether the tie result is shown if no home base is destroyed or no player's tank is destroyed three times in 3 minutes. Check whether the player 1 win result is shown if player 1's tank destroys player 2's tank three times or destroys player 2's home base in 3 minutes. Check whether the player 2 win result is shown if player 2's tank destroys player 1's tank three times or destroys player 1's home base in 3 minutes.}\\ \newline 
  FR21. All the players' tanks in both \underline{PVP} and \underline{PVE} mode shall have only 3 life.\\
  \textcolor{red}{Rationale: Both player's tanks only have 3 life because it is a element for determining the result of the game.\\

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
The new game is designed to run on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. However, the systems will be updated in the future and we are not able to test the compatibility now, and it may lead to some unexpected problems on the updated systems.
\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
The following off-the-shelf solutions are required:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \underline{original open source project}, Tankwar, which is implemented in python. Available from https://github.com/wangxingyao/TankWar
\item The pygame plugin. Available from https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
\end{itemize}

\subsection{New Problems}
Some players may be addicted to the new game, and this can result in eye problems includes eye soreness and eye strain.
\subsection{Tasks}
The tasks for our \underline{project} are based on the deliverable outline, which is set by the professor. \textcolor{red}{The schedule can be referenced from the Table 3 and the gantt chart below.}\\

The project is divided into three phases as well, the first phase is to design the project, we decide all the things to be done in this phase. The second phase is implementation, and a running new game shall be provided at the end of this phase. The last phase is the testing, all the functions of the new game shall be tested and improved.\\

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
None.
\subsection{Risks}
One of the problems is to implement the map editing mode. The map editing mode requires \underline{developers} to design a user interface to create maps and a mean to saving map in the local machine. All group members did not have experience to construct a similar game map editor before. It required \underline{developers} to learn amount of design knowledge and coding implementation skill in pygame. Testing is also a problem since there are too many functions and branches, and they are hard to be completely covered.
\subsection{Costs}
The only cost to develop the \underline{project} is time. All three \underline{developers} will spend about 6 hours every week on this \underline{project} and it will be about 72 hours in total for each one.
\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
A user guide will be shown during the game. It will introduce the tank operation instruction and game rules to the players in order to let players have a basis knowledge about the game.
\subsection{Waiting Room}
The new possibilities of the game can be made in the map editing mode, tanks, and prevention of game addiction. In the map editing mode, it can be added more different types of land form to give more choices. For the tanks, more types of tanks can be added to the game so that the players will have more choices. Moreover, the health and safety issue would be considered. The game addiction prevention system would be developed and added into the game.

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
The new land forms can be implemented in python. For example, there may be grass and pools in the map. The tanks can hide in the grass, and the river can limit the movements of the tanks. For the new tanks, they can also be designed and implemented in python. Moreover, an achievement system can be developed in order to track player's gaming progress. After getting a special new achievement, players can get a corresponding new tank as a reward. Additionally, the game addiction prevention system shall be able to count the daily playing time and continuous playing time. If the daily playing time is more than 4 hours, the game will be locked for 24 hours and will not allow anyone to play the game. If the continuous playing time is more than 1 hour, the game will be locked for 14 minutes to let the players rest for their eyes.
